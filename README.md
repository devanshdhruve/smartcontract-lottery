# Lottery DApp

This is a decentralized lottery application built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts and Hardhat as the development environment. Users can participate by entering the lottery, and one lucky participant is chosen randomly as the winner. The app integrates with wallets like MetaMask to allow users to connect and interact with the lottery.

## Features

- **Random Winner Selection:** A winner is randomly selected from the participants.
- **Prize Distribution:** The entire pool of ETH collected is sent to the winning participant.
- **Connect Wallet:** Users can connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the lottery.
